# Customize Project

One-time interactive setup that replaces all `jperdior-template` placeholders with your project's identity and records what you're building in `AGENTS.md` so every future AI session starts with context.

## Workflow

Ask the following questions **one at a time** (do not ask all at once):

1. **Project short name** — kebab-case, e.g. `my-blog`. Used in `Makefile`, root `package.json`, and the README title.
2. **Author or org handle** — kebab-case, e.g. `johndoe`. Replaces `jperdior` in all npm package scopes (`@jperdior/`) and Composer vendor names (`jperdior/`).
3. **One-sentence description** — appears in the README intro and `AGENTS.md`.
4. **What are you building?** — 2–3 sentences about the domain, users, and main goal. Goes into `AGENTS.md` so AI agents understand the project without reading the code.

After collecting the four answers, **show a summary** of every file that will change and what will be replaced. Ask for confirmation before applying.

Before applying any edits, **create a branch**:
```sh
git checkout -b chore/customize-project-<name>
```

## Changes applied on confirmation

| File | What changes |
|------|-------------|
| `README.md` | Title (`# jperdior-template` → `# <name>`) + intro paragraph |
| `Makefile` | `PROJECT_NAME := jperdior` → `PROJECT_NAME := <name>` |
| `package.json` (root) | `"name": "jperdior-template"` → `"name": "<name>"` |
| `packages/api-client-ts/package.json` | `"name": "@jperdior/api-client-ts"` → `"@<handle>/api-client-ts"` |
| `packages/ui-react/package.json` | `"name": "@jperdior/ui-react"` → `"@<handle>/ui-react"` |
| `packages/shared-kernel-php/composer.json` | `"name": "jperdior/shared-kernel-php"` → `"<handle>/shared-kernel-php"` |
| `apps/api/composer.json` | `"name": "jperdior/api"` + `"jperdior/shared-kernel-php"` dependency ref |
| `apps/web/package.json` | `"name": "@jperdior/web"` + workspace refs `@jperdior/api-client-ts`, `@jperdior/ui-react` |
| `apps/admin/package.json` | Same as web |
| `AGENTS.md` | Prepend a `## Project Context` section |

After applying all edits, **prepend** this block to `AGENTS.md` (after the `# Agents Guidelines` heading):

```markdown
## Project Context

**Name:** <name>
**Description:** <one-sentence description>

<what-are-you-building paragraph>

---
```

Finally, **commit and push**, then **open a PR**:
```sh
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: customize project for <name>"
git push -u origin chore/customize-project-<name>
gh pr create --title "chore: customize project for <name>" \
  --body "Renames template placeholders and adds project context to AGENTS.md."
```

## Output

```
Done. Renamed jperdior-template → <name> across all package files.

Added project context to AGENTS.md — every AI session will now know what you're building.

PR opened: <PR URL>

Next steps:
  make start                      — start the stack if not already running
  /new-feature                    — create a worktree + branch for your first feature
  /spec-writing                   — design the first feature spec-first (recommended)
```

## Rules

- Ask questions one at a time — do not dump all four at once.
- Always show the summary and ask for confirmation before applying any edits.
- Never change the PHP namespace (`App\`) — it is Symfony's standard and renaming it would touch every PHP source file. The `composer.json` name field is sufficient.
- Never overwrite the user's answers — if they want to re-run, they can edit the files directly.
- If any file is missing (e.g., `packages/shared-kernel-php/composer.json`), skip it silently and note it in the summary.
- Commit as a single clean commit — don't split across multiple commits.
